## Getting a WalletConnect Project ID (Optional)

While RainbowKit works without a project ID for testing, you should get one for production:

1. Go to: https://cloud.reown.com/
2. Sign up/Login
3. Create a new project
4. Copy the Project ID
5. Add to your `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
   ```

## Benefits Over Direct MetaMask

1. **Universal Support**: Works with any wallet, not just MetaMask
2. **Mobile-First**: Perfect mobile experience with QR codes and deep linking
3. **Better UX**: Professional wallet selection interface
4. **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects installed wallets
5. **Multi-Chain**: Easy to add more blockchains
6. **Maintained**: RainbowKit is actively maintained by the Rainbow team

## Testing

The integration is ready to test:

1. Try on desktop with MetaMask
2. Try on mobile with MetaMask Mobile or any wallet app
3. Try the QR code flow
4. Test disconnect/reconnect

Your wallet connection now works seamlessly across all devices! üöÄ

## Next Steps

2. Get your WalletConnect project ID for production
3. Deploy to staging/production
4. Enjoy the improved user experience!

## Technical Implementation

- **Service**: `src/services/rainbowKitWalletService.js`
- **Context**: `src/contexts/WalletContext.jsx` (updated)
- **Main Setup**: `src/main.jsx` (includes RainbowKit providers)
- **UI Component**: `src/components/FloatingProfile.jsx` (will be updated next)

The implementation maintains the same interface as before, so all your existing code continues to work!
